Non-marketable securities consist of Domestic Series, Foreign Series, State and Local Government Series (SLGS), U.S. Savings Securities, and Government Account Series (GAS) securities. Marketable securities are negotiable and transferable and may be sold on the secondary market. Non-marketable securities are not negotiable or transferrable and are not sold on the secondary market.

The big mac index was invented by The Economist in 1986 as a lighthearted guide to whether currencies are at their “correct” level. It is based on the theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP), the notion that in the long run exchange rates should move towards the rate that would equalise the prices of an identical basket of goods and services (in this case, a burger) in any two countries.  In order to create the adjusted index, a Big-Mac-adjusted per-capita GDP is used, which is the GDP in local currency, divided by the exchange rate as determined by Big Macs (that is, the price in local currency divided by the price in the United States). This performs a similar function to purchasing-power parity adjustments, but using only the price of a Big Mac to make the adjustment.\",\"allowed_aggregations\":[\"percentage-change-since-start\",\"year-over-year\"]}\n",
